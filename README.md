# kata-functional-js
## What
A little set of practise exercises to allow me to practise some functional programming practises in javascript.

## Why
I've recently noticed that i could use functional programming to architect some recursive React components. However, i'm not quite there yet when it comes to thinking in functional terms.
Solution : Write some exercises that allow me to write some functional solutions everyday!

## How:
This application is going to follow the typical kata style of my other projects.
