# Styles of tests to implement:
* generators
  * this is my version of the functional generator, not the actual ES6 generator
  * creating a generator that increments
  * using the generator to create an array, full of numbers
* composition:
  * is there a way we can easily build composition chains in es6, without the use of another library?
  * function compose( ...functions ) => returns a function that's that
  * allow compose to do currying?
  * pipe function createPipe( ...functions ) => returns a function pipe
    * the first function can take N values, the rest take 1.
